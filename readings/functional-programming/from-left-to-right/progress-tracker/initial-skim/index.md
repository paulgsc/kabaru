## Quick Summary

In 2-3 sentences, what is this paper about?

> Did a quick skim only so far, and first impression was the paper was unexpectedly long. It's several chapters and effectively a small text book. Nevertheless it touches on how to implement dsa in functional programming langauges in an ecosystem where the focus has been on imperative langauges like C only. I believe that a thorough read of this paper will allow me to have a much better foundational grasp of algorthms and their motivations thus I fully intend on reading through it.
